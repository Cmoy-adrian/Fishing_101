                    <h2>Why Are Bass Commonly Targeted?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In my experience, bass are commonly targeted because they are everywhere and fun to catch.
                        They are in almost every body of water, and are active (pretty much) all year-round. <br>
                        Plus, most bait companys generally make lures for bass specifically, so there is an ease of access element to it.
                        On top of that, bass fishing has one of the lowest bars for entry, making it very beginner friendly.

                    <h2>What Do You Need to Get Started?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The following list includes all the gear you need to get started:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <!-- List of gear. -->
                        <li>A rod that can handle bass fishing.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <!-- Embedded list to hold extra content. -->
                            <li>There are plethera of options when it comes to rods, 
                                but when it comes to bass fishing I ususally stick to a 7' medium-heavy rod.
                                They handle all types of lures and soft baits well; giving you that extra edge against the competition.
                                Plus, I find that using a medium-heavy rod gives you the right sensitivity to feel when the bass bite.
                                When it comes to buying a rod, any combo will do, but if you really want to customize your setup,
                                I would go to a well established fishing business and buy the rod just by itself. 
                                You don't have to blow your budget, spending around $80-$100 on the right rod will give you the durabilty you need to fight the bass,
                                and the test of time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>A reel with the power to fight the bass.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> There are plenty of reels on the market, in a variety of styles. But there are two main styles of reel used for fishing bass.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Spinning Reels</li>
                                    <li>Baitcasting Reels</li>
                                </ol>
                                While they both have there pros and cons, spinning reels are widely regarded as the best for begineers.
                                Spinning reels are easy to cast, and backlash half as much as a baitcaster.
                                Plus, they usually cast farther then baitcasters; allowing you to reach the bass from far away.
                                When picking out a reel for the first time look for a 2000-2500 size spinning reel with a 5:1 or 6:1 gear ration.
                                As stated with rods, you don't have to blow the bank for a reel. When first getting started a reel within the $80-$100 range will suffice.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Sturdy line that won't snap easily, and won't strain under the basses weight.</li>
                        <li>Lures that attract bass, and trigger attacks.</li>
                        <li>Tackle (weights, hooks, swivels, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Somewhere to store your stuff.</li>
                    </ul>
