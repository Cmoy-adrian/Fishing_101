                    <h2>Why Are Bass Commonly Targeted?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In my experience, bass are commonly targeted because they are everywhere and fun to catch.
                        They are in almost every body of water, and are active (pretty much) all year-round. <br>
                        Plus, most bait companys generally make lures for bass specifically, so there is an ease of access element to it.
                        On top of that, bass fishing has one of the lowest bars for entry, making it very beginner friendly.

                    <h2>What Do You Need to Get Started?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A rod, a reel, and some bass lures. That's about it. 
                        There are specific rods and reels that are better then others, but that's for another section.
