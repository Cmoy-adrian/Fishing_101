                <h2>Big Fish, Little Fish, One Fish, Two Fish -</h2>
                <p>
                    No matter what kind of fish you want to catch, big or small,
                    I believe that my knowledge could take you from one or two fish, to a full ice chest of fish!

                    <h3>Before You Leave -</h3>
                
                    <ol>
                        <!-- List of stuff to do/ know before you go on a fishing trip. -->
                        <li>Know what fish you're targeting.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <!-- Embedded list to hold extra content. -->
                            <li>Never go fishing without knowing what species you are targeting, 
                            if you don't, you're bound to catch nothing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>A little research can go along way.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you found yourself on this page, then goodjob!
                                That means you are already following this rule, even if you didn't know it. <br>
                                Researching when to fish for your target species, what to use, and where to go,
                                makes you more confident as a angler. <br>
                                Besides fishing wouldn't be very fun if you had no idea what you were doing.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Rig up BEFORE leaving.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pretty self explantory, rigging up will allow you to began fishing sooner.
                                The more you fish, the more you catch!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Make sure you have extra tackle.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Let's be honest, everyone snags there hook and everyone eventually snaps there line.
                                Bringing extra tackle ensures that one bad snag won't end your trip early.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If you follow this list, I ensure that you will have a long, and enjoyable, time out on the water.

                    <h3>Good Things to Remember -</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <!-- List of things to remember when fishing. -->
                        <li>Patience is key.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <!-- Embedded list to hold extra content. -->
                            <li>Patience is what seperates the average from the best anglers. 
                                Everyone has had periods of time where they don't feel a bite, but having the patience to keep casting is key. <br>
                                Besides, not knowing when a fish is going to bite makes it fun!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>You won't always walk away with tons of fish.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I know I said that I can help you get an "ice chest full" of fish, but to be honest I lied.
                                No matter how much knowledge you have you will never be guaranteed a fish. <br>
                                Even so, each trip is a learning experience that will help you fish in the future.
                                I'm still learning things about fishing everyday!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>HAVE FUN!!!</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The most important thing to remember while fishing! 
                                If you aren't having fun, then you shouldn't be fishing.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Remembering these things will make you a better angler in general, and more enjoyable to be around.
