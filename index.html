                <p>
                    No matter what kind of fish you want to catch, big or small,
                    I believe that my knowledge could take you from one or two fish, to a full ice chest of fish!

                                <li>Never go fishing without knowing what species you are targeting, 
                                if you don't, you're bound to catch nothing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>A little research can go along way.</li>

                                <li>If you found yourself on this page, then goodjob!
                                    That means you are already following this rule, even if you didn't know it.
                                    Researching when to fish for your target species, what to use, and where to go,
                                    makes you more confident as a angler.
                                    Besides fishing wouldn't be very fun if you had no idea what you were doing.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Rig up BEFORE leaving.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pretty self explantory, rigging up will allow you to began fishing sooner.
                                    The more you fish, the more you catch!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Make sure you have extra tackle.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Let's be honest, everyone snags there hook and everyone eventually snaps there line.
                                    Bringing extra tackle ensures that one bad snag won't end your trip early.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            If you follow this list, I ensure that you will have a long, and enjoyable, time out on the water.

                            <li>Patience is key.</li>

                                <li>Patience is what seperates the average from the best anglers. 
                                    Everyone has had periods of time where they don't feel a bite, but having the patience to keep casting is key. <br>
                                    Besides, not knowing when a fish is going to bite makes it fun!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>You won't always walk away with tons of fish.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    I know I said that I can help you get an "ice chest full" of fish, but to be honest I lied.
                                    No matter how much knowledge you have you will never be guaranteed a fish.
                                    Even so, each trip is a learning experience that will help you fish in the future.
                                    I'm still learning things about fishing everyday!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>HAVE FUN!!!</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The most important thing to remember while fishing! 
                                    If you aren't having fun, then you shouldn't be fishing.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Remembering these things will make you a better angler in general, and more enjoyable to be around.
